## To Do
### ``magpie/handler/search.py``
(line 35) this doesn't play well with colons in filenames


### ``utils/email_notes.py``
(line 43) there seems to be a bug where other notes in other notebooks can be deleted

(line 99) add try/except like web to prevent this from failing if there's no change


### ``utils/pdf_scraper.py``
(line 18) figure out why line breaks don't seem to be rendering
